# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Notes

My largest roadblock was working with Visx, as I didn't find the docs very intuitive. This took up most of my time and I didn't end up with much time for polish in terms of design. However, I am a fan of fairly minimalist design so I'm happy with how it looks.
I was trying to add another filter to allow showing results by author, but I wasn't able to get this finished before the 6 hours was up. You can see the reverted commit in the repo history.
